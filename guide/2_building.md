Ushahidi is a tool, not a strategy. It can help you achieve a goal, but only if you have first decided what you want to do. The decision to deploy Ushahidi must be preceded by a larger set of questions about what you want to accomplish. This section will take you through a process of building this strategy and the design of your campaign to reach your goals. While each organization will have its own approach to scoping out a project, one way to explore an Ushahidi deployment is through the following steps:


1.    Define your Objectives and Goals Defining what you are trying to accomplish is key to success. Understanding your group or organization’s goals and the individual objectives required to achieve them will help you define your specific activities and how the Ushahidi platform or Crowdmap can help you accomplish them.

2.    Identify Partners Partnerships are key to the success of your project. From local CSOs to government ministries and international organizations, partners give access to data, volunteers, local knowledge, and resources (both technical and financial).

3.    Understand what data are necessary to achieve your goals Take the time to think about why you are collecting data in the first place. What kind of data do you need to collect and how will a specific analyst use that data? Will the stories or reports you aggregate be used for evidence in a human rights campaign or election monitoring project, or will they be used to build situational awareness around a crisis? Is the effort a first step to putting health facilities on a map, or is your effort a means of tracking the supply chain signals necessary for keeping those hospitals stocked with a specific drug?

4.    Design your approach to Data Different partners may require data to be in specific formats or to adhere to certain standard. Different use cases will also necessitate different forms of data. Designing your data collection method and data model will be critical to your success. It is here when you will decide if Ushahidi is the tool for your project, or just one of several tools that you will need to reach your goals.

5.    Design your Team Ushahidi can provide the platform for collecting and processing data, but it is not a silver bullet. Staff and participants must be organized and managed to do the work. What kind of staffing is necessary to collect, cluster, deduplicate, translate, geolocate, verify, analyze, and visualize data from an Ushahidi deployment?

6.    Secure Resources No project proceeds without people, funding, and the technical resources to achieve your goals. What resources do you need to make your project a success?

7.    Establish Project Management Processes Timelines, volunteer schedules, technical development work plans, and terms of reference. Scheduling shifts and staff time is a critical path to success. Volunteers need structure, and data needs consistent handling.


## 1. Define your Objectives and Goals

Thinking about the goals and objectives of your Ushahidi project is one of the most important investments you can make to set up your team and organization for success. At Ushahidi, we differentiate goals and objectives from activities. Each activity in your deployment should be a tractable action that contributes to one or more objectives. Each objective should be a phase or thematic area of your overall project, designed to help you meet an overarching goal.

For example, during an election monitoring deployment, the primary goal may be to guarantee transparency around voting. One objective under that goal might be to capture reports of fraud. A common activity in fraud tracking is to enable citizens to report election fraud via SMS. Another activity is to map and categorize all polling stations. Another is the process of verifying reports of fraud and mapping them by polling station. Each contributes to the overall goal.

### Stating your Goals

Articulating your goal outside of the technology is a good exercise. You should try to complete the following sentence: we are mobilizing (who) to do (what) so that we can (why)? The Who is your target participants. The What is one or more key objectives. The Why is one or more goals. For example: we are mobilizing women to document incidents of sexual harrassment so that we can create consciousness of how prevalent the behavior is and create data necessary to obtain donor funding around education in the effects of harrassment.

## 2. Building your Objectives

You may need to meet one or more objectives to meet a specific goal or goals. Break down the goal into phases so that you can state these objectives to your team. A harrassment mapping project might have as objectives:


1.    Document incidents of sexual harrassment in 15 neighborhoods over a period of 6 months.
2.    Develop a report for government ministries and local NGOs about harrassment based on the data
3.    Draft a funding request for donors to support additional education work in sexual harrassment’s effects targeted at men in 15 neighborhoods.


### Turning Objectives into tangible actions

Each objective will need to have activities set against it. For example, the objective of “documenting incidents of sexual harrassment in 15 neighborhoods over a period of 6 months” might break down as follows:


1.    Recruit 30 neighborhood coordinators to educate women about the initiative and ask them to commit to
2.    Train neighborhood coordinators in the research methodology
3.    Deploy the Ushahidi platform in partnership with the local telco
4.    Collect observations of sexual harrassment

<p class="alert">
What is the difference between goals and objectives?
If a given project has achieved the organization’s clearly stated goal and objectives, then the project is considered successful. To make it clear, consider that the goal is achieved by accomplishing a number of objectives; objectives are achieved by producing a set of outputs; and outputs are produced by implementing a series of activities, which are concrete events or services.”- Ushahidi Blog
</p>

Sometimes, Ushahidi or Crowdmap is part of the first steps of a whole new initiative. This is exciting and spending the time to think first about your goals regardless of technology can set you up for success.

<p class="alert">
SIDEBAR: Ushahidi cannot solve all problems: it is a platform to allow a network of observers to contribute data and a network of analysts to make sense of those data. We have heard of it being considered for customer relationship management, document management, and other use cases beyond the scope of what it is capable of doing.
</p>

## 3. Identify Partners
Partnerships are key to the success of your project. From local CSOs to government ministries and international organizations, partners give access to data, volunteers, local knowledge, and resources (both technical and financial). The structure of many crowdsourcing efforts are also becoming multi-institutional collaborations, described by the mantra of “small pieces, loosely joined.” One group handles mapping, another translation, and a third performs data analysis.

<p class="alert">
	Uchaguzi Partnership
Before the referendum Uchaguzi partners met in Nairobi. Attendees included CRECO, SODNET, Ushahidi, Uraia, and HIVOS. Each group had unique assets and complementary strengths. For example CRECO had previous election monitoring experiences and a large trusted network of monitors. Ushahidi served as the core technical partner for the project, providing developers and convening volunteers. The collective action among all five organizations was a success. Despite many challenges and areas for future improvements a single organization would not have succeeded alone because no one group had all the necessary skills and resources.
Whether you will running an Ushahidi instance solely within one organization or as a mutli-institutional partnership, it is wise to map out the space where other organizations can contribute to your effort.
</p>

### Choosing your Partners

When choosing partners, consider several factors:


1.    Is the organization undertaking work in a similar context?
2.    How trusted is the organization in the communities that you would like reach?
3.    What contextual knowledge would the partner provide?
4.    Can the partner share its resources, including workspaces and local relationships?
5.    How open is the partner to working in new ways and facing the challenges of learning in a collaborative dynamic?


In information insecure settings such as conflict-driven complex humanitarian crisis and human rights reporting trusted partnerships are very important; not only for the success of the project, but often for the safety of those involved.

### Understanding your partner’s working environment

If you have a partnership with a CSO, community-based organization or partner in a limited digital environment plan ahead with both resources and time to ensure that they are able to join meetings and conference calls. If possible, consider arranging a meeting in their location, especially if they are linked to communities that you intend to crowdsource information with. Experiencing the reality of how a digitally limited environment will connect with your Ushahidi project. This can provide valuable design lessons going forward.

### Getting to know each other and building trust
Discovering and shaping how your partners are working together takes time. During the 2010 Uchaguzi referendem, the project drew together 5 major partners. It was essential to bring them together for face-to-face meeting not only for planning, but to help each of the principles to recognize each others’ strengths and how their organizations might complement one other. Face-toface meetings were also the way that partners worked out their expectations of each other and defined (and honed) their respective roles and responsibilities.


## 3. Understand what data are necessary to achieve your goals
Because you are planning on using the Ushahidi platform or Crowdmap as part of your project, you will be working with information and data. Frequently projects not only collect data in many different ways, but also share data; sometime publicly or with partners. Thinking closely and working with your team members to design how your data will be collected, organized, and shared using Ushahidi or Crowdmap is key.

Take the time to think about why you are collecting data in the first place. What kind of data do you need to collect and how will a specific analyst use that data? Will the stories or reports you aggregate be used for evidence in a human rights campaign or election monitoring project, or will they be used to build situational awareness around a crisis? Is the effort a first step to putting health facilities on a map, or is your effort a means of tracking the supply chain signals necessary for keeping those hospitals stocked with a specific drug?

Understanding how the data will be used will help you define the structure of the collection, the methods of curation and verification, and your approach to sharing the data.

## 4. Design your Approach to Data

While the Ushahidi platform will help you collect, organize, display and (sometimes) communicate your data, it will not automatically collect data for you, nor will it magically recruit a crowd. You must first develop a strategy to engage participants to collect and curate the data that you need for the analytical challenge that you need to tackle. You must develop a crowdsourcing strategy as part of your campaign to achieve a goal.=

To build this strategy, you will need to first understand your choices around crowdsoucing methods and how crowdsourcing relies on techniques from grassroots organizing. This chapter will lead you through these decisions and then layout one process for designing an Ushahidi deployment. The output will be a document that describes your approach to your team, partners, and the communities that you wish to reach.

###Crowdsourcing: Outlining Your Choices

Over the past 8 years, Ushahidi has become synonymous with crowdsourcing. That said, this association mixes up a tool for data collection with the method of data collection. While crowdsourcing is one way in which organization collect data via Ushahidi platforms (and is often the way in which data gets analyzed), it is not the only way. Clients have used Ushahidi as a platform for collecting and curating data using only their internal staff around traditional survey methods. Some have even used Ushahidi as a platform for tracking data streams from automated sensors, with no humans directly involved.

The way you choose to use Ushahidi will depend on your goals and preferred mechanisms for handling data. While crowdsourcing information through SMS, Twitter, Facebook and other social media can have powerful results, it is not a magic bullet and requires an investment in communicating “with the crowd”. This investment may well be as expensive as traditional methods—perhaps more so on your first go round.

If you have an ongoing project and want to collect the opinions from the public over the year, this work will require a campaign strategy and resources to keep your public community informed of your project. You will need to think about how you will keep the community engaged and find creative ways to make this happen. This might include a feedback strategy, games, and even in person meetings, depending upon your environment.

Quote Crowdsourcing, the idea of soliciting information from citizens and relying on their participation to achieve certain goals is almost 10 years old. We ourselves, have been building products that allow users to collect, curate and visualize information since 2008, relying solely on the power of the masses. - David Kobia, Director of Technology Development, Ushahidi’

This section will help you decide on your method of data collection and data analysis. Either or both can be crowdsourced, or the effort can be kept entirely in house. Which option you choose will be based on the use case, available resources, and strategy for citizen engagement.

### Methods of Data Collection
Ushahidi can support several modes of data collection and analysis. The four most common use cases are unbounded and bounded crowdsourcing, traditional survey and analysis methods, and automated sensors.

####Unbounded crowdsouring

For events with wide reach to the general public, Ushahidi can enable you to include anyone in the public space who is aware of the campaign and has learned how to send information via SMS, social media, email, or the Web. This approach can enable you to collect large volumes of information. However, because the general public tends to send information that is formatted in a wide variety of syntaxes, it needs cleansing before it can be used. Data collected via unbounded crowdsourcing may not be reliable.

#### Bounded crowdsourcing

For campaigns that require deeper training or deal with more sensitive issues, organizations often ask a bounded group of individuals or organization to send data into the Ushahidi platform. For example, during the Uchaguzi election monitoring project, trusted election monitors sent information via SMS into the Uchaguzi platform, each of which were then processed by trusted volunteers.

####Traditional Surveys

Ushahidi can support tradition survey methods, where a relatively small team of individuals can send in data using structured survey forms. These data can then be pulled into a statistical analysis tool or online package by professional analysts.

#### Automated Sensors

Because the new version of Ushahidi is built around an Application Programming Interface (API), it now supports the collection of new data from sensors and other automated channels, including bots and other data collection tools that have APIs.

### Choosing an Approach

( checklist to build with Jennifer )

### Methods of Data Curation and Analysis

Just as Ushahidi supports multiple modes of data collection, it also supports multiple modes of data curation and analysis. The two most common are to use internal, traditional analysis and to crowdsource the curation and analysis to a pool of volunteers or experts.

#### Internal Analysis

During most small-to-medium campaigns, an internal analyst will manage all the data curation and analysis. This approach generally uses existing staff who are assigned to the project to manage the data once it arrives in the Ushahidi platform.

####Crowdsourced Curation and Analysis

In contrast, large campaigns often require bounded crowdsourcing to handle 10,000s or 100,000s of messages. This effort requires recruiting, training, and managing an online team of volunteers who will translate, geolocate, verify, and approve each message in a workflow that you will design. This work requires an internal staff member to organize and manage this volunteer workforce. With this approach, analysis may still be done by an internal staff member or team, or it might be crowdsourced to a working group of volunteers. The choice will vary on the sensitivity of the data, proection issues, as well as the complexity of the final analytical product needed. The more complex the work (i.e., the more it requires years of experience and training), the more likely it will be to performed by an individual or team who is specifically chosen for the task, often an internal staff member or consultant hired for the project.

## 5. Create your Team
Ushahidi can provide the platform for collecting and processing data, but it is not a silver bullet. Staff and participants must be organized and managed to do the work. Based on your choices around data collection, curation, and analysis, you may need to create several teams composed of a mix of paid staff and volunteers. What kind of staffing is necessary to collect, cluster, deduplicate, translate, geolocate, verify, analyze, and visualize data from an Ushahidi deployment?

### Operations

Running the deployment will generally entail the following positions:

* Project Manager: the person who is in charge of the overall strategy and management of the initiative.
* Volunteer Manager: the person(s) who are in charge of volunteer recruitment, training, scheduling, and retention.
* Technologist: the persons in charge of the Ushahidi platform, the server environment, and any other technology running the project.
* Analyst: the persons responsible for turning data into insights.


### Data Collection

It is tempting to list the “crowd” as the key player in data collection. However, mobilizing public activity is the job of organizers, who recruit other volunteer organizers who (in turn) ask participants to commit to sending data to Ushahidi. Sometimes, advertising can work by itself (e.g., a radio spot asking people to text a certain bit of data to a shortcode or phone number). More often, someone needs to mobilize activity. This team would be responsible for this work.


If you are going to use an internal team or hire a survey firm, this work will instead be performed using staff or consultants which also require project management. There is no silver bullet.

### Data Curation

Turning submitted observations into useful data usually requires a workflow that normalizes, translates, geolocates, verifies, and approves messages for use, and sometimes even a process to publish each report back to the public. Often, each of these activities requires a specially trained team of volunteers in a working group.
Exactly which activity will be needed for your deployment will depend on a range of factors.

* How many people are contributing data? Data submitted by thousands of individual contributors will be very different that thousands of reports submitted by a few trusted staff.
* How many languages are involved? If the deployment is happening in an area where the local language differs from the language in which the analysis needs to be written, or occurs in place with multiple local languages, the project management will need to decide on how to handle translation. If translation is desirable, it is something that tends to be done by crowdsourcing quickly (though there can be accuracy issues).
* What geographic accuracy is needed? Reported locations can be confusing in regions where addresses are narratives rather than municipally-assigned parcels. Turning these narratives into GPS points can be very time consuming and require local knowledge. If this level of accuracy is needed, it is likely that a geolocation working group will need to be staffed.
* What level of verification is needed? Verifying individual reports is always important. However, in cases where observations capture events which may have multiple perspectives, or where inaccurate data might be deliberately submitted, verification of each report becomes a critical activity. Management will need to decide on what level of verification is necessary to use an given report in the analysis.
* What data will be released to the public? Many Ushahidi deployments provide a public view of the data. In only rare cases are these public views of the raw reports. In most cases, each publically-available report goes through a verification process and subsequent approval for release. A team will need to be responsibile for making decisions about a) which reports can be made public, and b) what data in those reports needs to be kept private (such as a person’s name, phone number, email, or other personally identifiable information).
* How sensitive will the data be? If the data .... (ex: Uchaguzi)

### Data Analysis

Making sense of available data tends to be performed by a relatively small group of experts. However, this need not always be the case. The collective intelligence of the crowd can be harnessed to build hypotheses as well as a technique to raise awareness about how to use the data. These approaches require staff to manage the analysis process as well as citizen engagement.

## 6. Secure Resources
No project proceeds without people, funding, and the technical resources to achieve your goals. Identifying resources do you need to make your project a success is a process that depends on scale of your project, the local context, and the technology needed to reach your goals. (Scale, Local Context, Technology).

Ushahidi may be free software, but deployments require time, resources and funding beyond the setting up technology itself. Chris Blow’s diagram provides a good starting point of how to anticipate the resources needed for your project.

### Information collection (SMS, Twitter, Digital data collection)

Different information sources can have different costs structures. For example in many countries sending SMS costs money and many projects will seek in-kind donations from telecommunications companies or seek funding to provide free SMS messaging for the unbounded or bounded crowd. In these cases planning the timeline of your project is important. Do you plan a single campaign over a holiday weekend? Or a project that will use SMS and short code for three years?

Other social media outlets such as Twitter may not have direct costs like SMS but have various indirect costs, such as technical staff to link twitter feeds to the platform. (more)

With the new Ushahidi version 3 software there is an opportunity to synergize mobile digital data collection tools with the Ushahidi form functionality. At this time, this requires customization of your Ushahidi platform and technical expertise as well as data management expertise. This will likely involve staffing costs to launch and maintain this type of information flow.

### The cost of championing a new idea in a traditional organization

Embarking on a crowdsourcing project in a traditional organization is often spearheaded by a champion; which may be the organization’s project manager, GIS specialist, or technical lead. Often there can be under-recognized demands that your champion may be taking on. Extra hours to create documents and host conference calls to advocate for the next steps of the Ushahid project. Evening hours to maintain relationships with volunteer groups who standby to assist with processing information on the platform. Consider reaching out to the Ushahidi community to connect with former and ongoing champions in similar organizations Seek their advice on how to estimate these costs and how to navigate any resource challenges.

What will is cost to mobilize communities? What transportation costs are associated with sending a mobilizer to a remote place? How much might SMS/text messages cost, or bandwidth

### Offline Activities
Despite the fact that Ushahidi is an online tool, many project have offline activities that are crucial to the project’s success. For example face to face meetings with partners in the form of workshops should have a budget associated with it. In addition, community meetings at churches, markets, and other venues can provide the necessary feedback environments for digitally limited members of your project. While they may be messaging via short code to your core team, learning about your project, being able to ask questions and receive feedback may occur offline. Resources such as transport, food, meeting venues may require funds.

### Maintaining relationships

1.    communities
2.    volunteer groups
3.    leadership/ head office

### Costing Model

What does a typical costing model look like?

1.    People/Staffing
2.    Partnerships
3.    Training/Simulation
4.    Data Storage
5.    Campaigning
6.    Hardware
7.    Evaluation

## 7. Establish Project Management

Hiring or assigning your project manager and giving him or her the authority and resources to hire additional positions is a critical first step. The PM will then recruit, train, and manage the processes by which the deployment will unfold. Both staff and volunteers need structure, and data needs consistent handling.

### Deployment Types

Organizations around the world have deployed the Ushahidi platform for many purposes: from crisis response and election monitoring to health and poverty mapping and sensor networks.

Ushahidi software has been used for a wide variety of purposes all over the world. We have over 3000 Ushahidi platform and Crowdmap deployments. If you’re thinking about what type of map to consider, read below about our common types of projects. Already have an idea for your Ushahidi deployment? Below are some examples of how they have been deployed and there are are lots of resources below to explore!

#### Human Rights Evidence Gathering

(more content here)Methods for both citizens and staff of human rights organizations to report evidence of human rights violation. Data is often used for advocacy or as evidence in legal proceedings.

Human Rights Evidence Gathering is an example of a long term deployment than can span months to years.

#### Crisis Reporting

A set of methods for collecting, geolocating, translating, verifying reports from natural disastesr and crises for situational awareness, advocacy and direct action. They are often either hot flash or slow burn deployments.

Hot flash- Hot Flash deployments such as Haiti Crisis Map, Japan Earthquake and many more are created quickly in response to large scale natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods

Slow Burn - Slow burn deployments continue for weeks to months and evening longer as they track and report on complex humanitarian crisis and disasters which are frequently due to war and conflict their end unclear. An example of a slow burn deployment is the Crowdmap Syria Tracker by volunteer-based non-profit organization Humanitarian Tracker

#### Citizen Journalism

Citizens are using the Internet to change their world, to give voice to issues that matter to them. Some do this in conjunction with official media organizations while others engage in their own mission. The power of Ushahidi is that anyone can locate, aggregate and provide a platform to unite many voices, many communication channels. Some examples include of citizen media projects include #OccupyMap

Our partners at Al Jazeera, Guardian, BBC, ABC Queensland, Houston Chronicle, Chicago Sun times and more have elected to engage the citizenry in their official storytelling using these tools. Occupy is an important map as they have used it to create their own community and storyline outside of the mainstream media. Their project is extensive with a global network of occupy mappers. Plus their highly customized platform includes a wiki and other tools to make it the center for all activity. This it is more than a map: it is a communications hub and platform in a starfish manner.

#### Election Monitoring

A set of methods for harnessing citizens to report on actions which impede free and fair elections.

Ushahidi has its roots in election monitoring and has been deployed in a number of countries for that specific purpose. Using crowdsourcing methods harnessing citizens to report on actions which impede free and fair elections. Examples of public crowdsourcing during elections include: India, Mexico, Afghanistan and Lebanon, all in 2009 and Sudan and Togo in 2010. Data collection using trained election monitors, or bounded crowdsourcing can also be done and Ushahidi was used in this way during the November 2009 elections in Namibia and during the 2010 elections in Burundi.

#### Health Mapping

A set of methods for mapping public health issues in a communities via crowdsourcing. Some Ushahidi maps have health facility or public health categories while some project have a primary health focus. For example the Map Liberia project gathers information about Liberia’s businesses, organizations and government agencies. Health facilities are included as well.

The Mer Swasthya Meri Aawa (My Health, My Voice) project collects information about hidden health care fees for maternal healthcare services in Uttar Pradesh,northern India. On the site you can see clinic locations and hidden costs reported at that clinic.

#### Poverty and Anti-Corruption Mapping

(add content here) A method for mapping poverty in communities and informal settlements.
Many organiaitons and community groups use Ushahidi and Crowdmap for anti-corruption activists.

Kuhonga’s essential insight is that crisis mapping and crowd-sourcing of data can be used to tackle the slow-motion crisis of endemic corruption…Kuhonga hopes to extend the success of social media by using Ushahidi’s crowdsourcing capabilities to tackle a different sort of social problem. (Ushahidi Blogpost-Kuhonga’s Anti-Corruption Strategy in Kenya )

#### Sensor Tracking

(needs content, not sure john?) A method of connecting sensors directly to the Ushahidi API for periodic reports on conditions in the field.

#### Environmental Mapping
